# How to work with me

We all have different personalities. We’ve all been shaped by profoundly different life experiences. We all communicate 
differently. But many times when we come into work, we’re expected to interact with each other in a templated, 
“one-size-fits-all” way. 

A culture of trust and transparency within a team can only be built with intention and self-awareness. Taking the time to 
reflect on what makes you most productive at work will almost certainly help drive your own success. Putting your 
weaknesses on the table sets the tone that you’re going to be vulnerable. Show that you’re not perfect, and you make 
mistakes. Your team will feel more empowered to do the same. This exercise will help ensure your colleagues (and you) 
understand not just who you are, but how to engage with you on a deeper level and collaborate with you most 
productively. Transparency about your work style – your preferences, values, quirks and all – shortens the learning curve 
for others by making explicit things that might otherwise take months, or even years, to uncover.

## Self-Focus 
- **What are your general work hours? When do you feel most productive during the workday?**
  
  I generally work one of two weekday schedules, depending either on the day or existing work arrangements:
    - 11am-7pm PST
    - 2pm-10pm PST

    I can adjust these schedules on a particular day to attend meetings (usually earlier in the day), but in practice
    this ends up being fairly disruptive. It can take me a long time to get going in the morning, unfortunately.

- **Do you keep your calendar up-to-date?**
  
  I make all available efforts to, yes. My phone calendar is the canonical source of scheduling for me, since it
  is a marged view of my work and personal calendars. I do my best to place holds on my calendar when personal events
  conflict with work hours, but I don't always remember.

- **How should we contact you? Do you acknowledge every message or do you only respond when necessary?**
  
  During the times listed above, I will make every effort to be immediately available on Slack or other chosen chat 
    medium for an organization.

  Outside those times, my devices will shift to a different Focus mode that silences notifications from work
    applications. If I am needed for incident response during these times, I will leave an alternate contact method that
    is not silenced such as SMS.

- **In what order do you prefer: meetings, emails, slacks, texts, calls, and/or video chats**
  
  In practice, I prefer Slack or other textual mediums for most communication, preferrably done in channels instead 
    of DMs. This allows others to join or observe the conversation and whatever knowledge transfer or decisions happen, 
    and provides a more durable record of these conversations if a participant leaves.

  Calls/video chat are often best only for pair programming, or conversations where spontenaity / back-and-forth are 
    parts of the experience.

- **How do you handle conflict?**
  
  I do my best at all times to:
    - Represent my viewpoints as simply that- viewpoints- which are informed by my experience and breadth of knowledge.
    - Remember that others' viewpoints are similarly informed by their experience and breadth of knowledge, and that they
      did not come by those viewpoints maliciously.

    With these in mind, I do my best to be explicit in my reasoning, and earnestly engage with the idea that I have not
    considered all the relevant facts of an issue. I do my best to assume that others will do the same, and where this 
    conflict that a mututally-beneficial way forward often exists that addresses all presented concerns.

    Where viewpoints are intractable, and conflicts between them irresolvable, I will consider the trust levels of the
    parties involved, and their roles in the implementation and maintenance of the solutions presented. Where I am the
    primary party, I will prevail upon the trust placed in me as a senior party and ask that a limited trial of my
    solution be put forth, to validate my claims. Where others are the primary party, I will do my best to extend that
    same level of trust to them and suggest the same limited trial so that at least some forward progress can be made.

- **What are the things that frustrate you?**
  
  I am frustrated primarily by needless complexity in any system that I engage with, be they technical or not. Experience
    has taught me that simplicity, both in the design process and in continual refinement, is the only way to keep a
    system conducive to maintenance. As someone who has been on-call for her entire career, and has been woken up at 4am
    by incidents, I have often been the most impacted by failures in this regard.
  
  I am also deeply frustrated when I encounter people- technical and otherwise- who lack of curiosity. Experience
    has also taught me that detailed and joyful exploration of the systems that we work on, and depend on, are essential
    elements both in modeling the operations of systems we are responsible for, and for our growth as engineers and as
    people.

- **What motivates you?**
  
  I am motivated by a few simple principles that drive the design of everything I do in my personal and professional life:

    - **Systems exist to serve human needs.** I think it's easy for the architects and implementers of
      systems to forget this crucial principle. Everything we do must be in joyful service to human beings, and our
      corresponding duty is to place human actors as the ultimate agents of anything we build.
    - **Excellence is best expressed through the excision of needless complexity.** Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
      said, *"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*
      As designers, engineers, and as human beings, our goal should be to seek the truly essential pieces of the systems
      we work on, and build only those. Everything else is unnecessary, except where it points the way to what is truly
      important.

- **What helps you get work done? What helps you be at your best?**
  
  I am helped primarily by deep understandings of the systems or features that I am working on, as well as trusted
    colleagues to check my homework.

- **What gaps are present in your mindset, attitudes, beliefs and competencies that are likely to become barriers to your success? What skills or behaviors are you actively working to improve?**
  
  I am actively seeking to develop my mentorship skills- I believe I am at a time in my career where giving back to
    the next generation is valuable.
  
  My aggressive focus on simplicity, and the continually experimental nature of how I write, can extend the time
    required to implement a feature. Deadlines can help mitigate this as they put an external time pressure to not mess
    around too much.
  
  My work often touches through multiple layers of a system at once, or bundles multiple features together because the
    implementation of one informed me of the need for the other. I sometimes struggle to make smaller PRs with more isolated
    changes because of this.

## Interactions with Others 
- **What do you need from your manager? How do you want to be managed?**
  
  My primary need from a manager is trust in my experience, and that I will do my absolute best to drive technical
    excellence in any organizations that I am a part of. This does not mean a blind acceptance of anything I do; I deeply
    respect people pushing back on my assumptions and helping to correct me.

- **How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?**
  
  In my experience, **the path to growth is through responsibility.** The best way that I have ever found to help
    someone grow is to trust them with the shepherding of something. Whether it is something they designed, or an extant
    system that they are adopting, fostering a sense of ownership and trust gives our fellow engineers a way to
    self-direct their growth in a way that I have found unlocks previously unknown reservoirs of creativity and motivation.

- **What do you need from your peers?**
  
  Similar to management, what I need most from my peers is an environment of trust; both that they trust me, and help me
    to trust them by putting their best foot forward.
